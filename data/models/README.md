# Models Folder

This folder stores trained machine learning models used by the PreCog application.

- `default_friction_model.joblib`: This is an example of a serialized machine learning model (likely saved using a library like scikit-learn's `joblib`). It represents a pre-trained model for friction risk assessment.
