# .idea Folder

This folder contains project-specific settings for the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. These settings include:

- `PreCog.iml`: Module file defining project structure, dependencies, and other module-specific settings.
- `inspectionProfiles/`: Contains code inspection profiles.
- `material_theme_project_new.xml`: Settings related to the Material Theme UI plugin, if used.
- `vcs.xml`: Version control system settings for the project.
- `workspace.xml`: Contains your workspace preferences, such as open files, run configurations, and window layout.

It's generally recommended to add this folder to your `.gitignore` file if you are working in a team, as these settings can be user-specific. However, for consistency across a team, some files like `.iml` and inspection profiles might be shared.
